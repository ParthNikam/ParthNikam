19 years old Studying Robotics and AI at MIT Bangalore
Currently working on building drone swarm algorithms for autonomous drones

I'm a full-stack ML engineer with a knack for building web applications and machine learning models
Everything I do stems from an intrinsic curiosity to understand how things work and and how can they provide value to people

I'm currently learning LLMs from scratch, down to the matrix multiplication level, cause I don't just want to be an API calling prompt monkey and actually have a deeper understanding of their architecture and computational limitations

You can find me on GitHub and LinkedIn
